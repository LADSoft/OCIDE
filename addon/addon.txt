The files in this directory aren't included with the normal distribution because
virus scanners like to disavow them.  They are distributed in separate zip files
with a password of 'orangec'.  Normally you won't need them for anything.  A
short description of each follows in case you want to look at them.

HX.ZIP is JAPHETHS MSDOS extender, which emulates windows console mode.  Many of
the windows console programs will run under MSDOS using the files in this extender.
as such, it is really only useful if you are running on MSDOS.  However, if
you do try to run the compiler on MSDOS you will need these files installed as
well as the compiler and tools are really windows console mode applications.

LSCRTL.ZIP is the C Runtime library for Orange C, packaged in DLL format.  It is 
mostly a curiosity at this point as you would want to do things another way, 
but is distributed in case you want to look at it.
